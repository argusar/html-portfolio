<h1>The Best Movies According to Amy</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lilo & Stitch</h3>
<p>Classic childhood movie, very wholesome and I love Elvis music.</p>
<h3>Dead Poet's Society</h3>
<p>Great messages on freedom/choosing the right path for yourself and the pressures and stress of academia placed on impressionable young people. Also, love Robin Williams.</p>
<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>Very fun and inspiring movie. The start of Marvel for me.</p>
